jsfest-nodebot
==============

This code was first used at a hack day event for [JSFest](http://jsfest.com/) 2014 in San Francisco, and then again for a kids workshop on robotics.

## Wiring

Here is the wiring diagram for the SumoBot. Make sure that you get everything wired up **exactly** as shown below. If you get any of the red and black wires crossed, you may damage the motors! Also make sure that none of the metal on the red and black wires ever come into contact, this will definitely damage the motors!



## Installation

- Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
- If you are on Windows, install [Git](http://www.git-scm.com/). Mac OS X and Linux come with Git preinstalled
- Open a terminal, and navigate to the folder you want to install the project at
- Run ```git clone ```
- ```cd``` into the ```jsfest-sf-2014-nodebot``` directory
- Run ```npm install```

## Running

- Plug the USB cable into your computer and the robot
- In the same terminal and directory where we ran ```npm install```, run ```node bot.js```
- Open your browser and navigate to ```http://localhost:8000/```
- Press the arrow keys to move the robot!
